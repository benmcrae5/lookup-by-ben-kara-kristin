# LookUp
LookUp is an astronomy-based app that allows the user to use their browser location at a chosen date and time to see a list of planetary objects that will be above them. Each search result includes a corresponding photo of the body from NASA Images.

## User Story
AS A novice astronomer<br>
I WANT to see which bodies (planets, moon or sun) are overhead at any given date or time at my location<br>
SO THAT I can be more knowledgeable about what’s there so I can better find them!<br>

GIVEN I am using this app to see available celestial bodies overhead<br>
WHEN I ask the app for my location<br>
THEN I am asked for permission to access my browser’s location<br>
WHEN I enter in the date and time<br>
THEN I am presented with a list of celestial bodies along with their pictures<br>
WHEN I want to look at previous searches<br>
THEN I can find a list of the most recent searches that will auto-populate the search fields.<br>
WHEN I refresh the page<br>
THEN I want to be able to see past searches<br>
